# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This is a monorepo containing a business application used to test the build system. The repository is in early setup — as packages and tooling are added, update this file accordingly.

## Repository State

The monorepo structure, package manager, build system, and application packages have not yet been configured. When they are added, document the following here:

- Package manager and workspace setup (e.g., `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `package.json` workspaces)
- How to install dependencies
- Build, test, and lint commands
- How to run individual packages or a single test
- Package dependency graph and inter-package relationships
